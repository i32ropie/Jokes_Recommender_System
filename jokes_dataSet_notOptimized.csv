This farmer also had two ducks.  These ducks were retarded.  They were only two ducks on the farm that weren't normal.  He told his sons that whoever could get the most money for the duck would go to college.  

The sons   went out in attempt to collect as much money as   they could.    The first son was walking down the street when he passed a man working in the yard.  The man asked him if the duck was for sale, for the man loved the taste of ducks.  He offered the son 10 dollars for his duck.  The son decided this was very good, so he took it.  He decided his brother wouldn't be able to get close to his success.

The second son was walking and passed a whorehouse.  He went in and said that he didn't have any money, but he would give them the duck.  One girl said fine. After they f**ked, she decided that she didn't want the duck anymore.  The son said he would take the duck back if they f**ked again.  She agreed.  After they f**ked the second time, the son left.  

He was walking home, thinking about what to do with the duck when it broke the leash.  The duck ran out into the street and was hit by a car.  The lady that hit it jumped from her car and started apologizing profusely.  The son insisted it was ok, but the lady said she would pay for the duck.  She was in a hurry, so she gave him 25 dollars and sped off.   

When the sons got home, the farmer asked the first son what he got.  He proudly displayed the 10 dollars.  The farmer was impressed.  He asked the second son the same thing.  

""That's nothing.  I got a f**k for a duck, a duck for a f**k, and 25 dollars for a f**ked up duck.""";185;;;

The man hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the sheep. So, he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back, and goes to bed.

The next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take, and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back, and goes to bed. 

The next morning he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the sheep and upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed.

Animal;Religious Nuts;"There were four country churches in a small Texas town: The Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, the Methodist Church and the Catholic Church. Each church was overrun with pesky squirrels. 
                             
One day, the Presbyterian Church called a meeting to decide what to do about the squirrels. After much prayer and consideration they determined that the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will. 
        
In the Baptist Church the squirrels had taken up habitation in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a cover on the baptistery and drown the squirrels in it. The squirrels escaped somehow and there were twice as many there the next week.  
        
The Methodist Church got together and decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creation. So, they humanely trapped the Squirrels and set them free a few miles outside of town. Three days later, the squirrels were back. 
         
But -- The Catholic Church came up with the best and most effective solution. They baptized the squirrels and registered them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.";119;;;

Animal;The Snail and the Dung Beetle;"Once, a long, long time ago, in a small village just outside of some place you've never heard of, there was quite a stir amongst the villagers. The villagers, you see, wanted to schedule a race so that they could support their compulsive gambling habits, but could not find their two main contestants, the tortoise and the hare, and were forced to search for replacements. 
Nobody in the village was willing to race, because they all wanted to bet on it and get drunk during the race. 

After many hours of searching, they found the best replacements they could, which happened to be a snail and a dung beetle. Neither of them wanted to  race, but were forced to do so by the rest of the villagers. And so the race was scheduled for the next day. That night, snail and dung beetle went out to the bar in order to prepare themselves for their race. After many hours, and many exotic, alcohol-filled drinks, snail and dung beetle were prepared for their race, and went off to their separate houses in order to get some sleep before the big race.

The next morning, snail got up early and headed out to the racetrack, and dung beetle did the same. They stood ready at the start line and got prepared for the race. Soon, the shot was fired, and the race began.  The dung beetle appropriately pooped himself. and the snail hid inside his shell.  The villagers went to war.";137;;;

Animal;Rocket Science;"Scientists at NASA have developed a gun built specifically to launch dead chickens at the windshields of airliners, military jets and the space shuttle, all traveling at maximum velocity.

The idea is to simulate the frequent incidents of collisions with airborne fowl to test the strength of the windshields.

British engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it on the windshield of their new high speed trains.   Arrangements were made.  But when the gun was fired, the engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurtled out of the barrel, crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to smithereens, crashed through the control console, snapped the engineer's backrest in two and embedded itself in the back wall of the cabin. 

Horrified Britons sent NASA the disastrous results of the experiment, along with the designs of the windshield, and begged the U.S. scientists for suggestions.

NASA's response was just three words, ""Thaw the chicken.""";96;;;

By the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped and hungry. Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener.   Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home   and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses,   knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back.  

Somehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food.    So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and   steady.  

Twenty days pass, but no Poncho.  Joe   and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise.  Another day passes, and still no   Poncho, but a promise is a promise.  After three   more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve   starts getting restless.  ""I NEED FOOD!"" he says   with a hint of dementia in his voice.    

""NO!"" Joe retorts.  ""We promised.""  

Five more days pass.  Joe realizes that Poncho   probably skipped out to the Burger King down the   road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get   a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat.  But   then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out   behind a rock.

God created the mule, and told him, ""You will be a mule, working constantly from dusk to dawn, carrying heavy loads on your back.  You will eat grass and lack intelligence.  You will live for 50 years.""

The mule answered, ""To live like this for 50 years is too much. Please, give me no more than 20.""  And it was so.

Then God created the dog, and told him, ""You will hold vigilance over the dwellings of Man, to whom you will be his greatest companion. You will eat his table scraps and live for 25 years.""
 

 And the dog responded, ""Lord, to live 25 years as a dog like that is too much.
Please, no more than 10 years."" And it was so.

God then created the
monkey, and told him, ""You are monkey.  You shall swing from tree to tree,
acting like an idiot. You will be funny, and you shall live for 20 years.""
 

 And the monkey responded, ""Lord, to live 20 years as the clown of the world is
too much.  Please, Lord, give me no than 10 years."" And it was so.

 Finally, God created Man
and told him, ""You are Man, the only rational being that walks the earth. You
will use your intelligence to have mastery over the creatures of the world. You will
dominate the earth and live for 20 years.""

 And the man responded, ""Lord,
to be Man for only 20 years is too little. Please, Lord, give me the 20 years the
mule refused, the the 15 years the dog refused, and the 10 years the monkey
rejected."" And it was so. 

And so God made Man to live 20 years as a man, then marry and live 20 years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his back. 

Then, he is to have children and live 15 years as a dog, guarding his
house and eating the leftovers after they empty the pantry.

 Then, in his old age, to live
10 years as a monkey, acting like an idiot to amuse his grandchildren.

Trekked the dusty caravan.                


Men on camels, two by two                


Destination -- Timbuktu.”

The current rooster was   still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in  years and the farmer figured getting a new rooster   couldn't hurt.  So he buys a new cock from the   local rooster emporium, and turns him loose in the   barnyard.    Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting   around and he's a little worried about being replaced. He walks up to   the new bird.

""So you're the new stud in   town?  I bet you really think you're hot stuff   don't you?  Well I'm not ready for the chopping   block yet.  I'll bet I'm still the better bird.    And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around   that hen house over there.  We'll run around it   ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have   all the hens for himself."" 
   
Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he   definitely thought he was more than a match for   the old guy.  

""You're on,"" he said, ""and since   I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of   half a lap.  I'll still win easy!""   

So the two roosters go over to the henhouse to   start the race with all the hens gathering to   watch.  The race begins and all the hens start   cheering the old rooster on.  After the first lap,   the old rooster is still maintaining his lead.   

After the second lap, the old guy's lead has   slipped a little -- but he's still hanging in there.  Unfortunately, the old rooster's lead continues to   slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's   just barely in front of the young fella.    By now the farmer has heard the commotion.  He   runs into the house, gets his shotgun and runs   into the barnyard figuring a fox or something is   after his chickens.  When he gets there, he sees   the two roosters running around the henhouse,   with the old rooster still slightly in the lead.    He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and   blows the young rooster away.

--If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth eating.

-- If you run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel-drive truck with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help, just stay out of their way -- this is what they live for.

-- Don't be surprised to find boiled peanuts, movie rentals and fishing bait in the same store.

-- Remember: ""Y'all"" is singular. ""All y'all"" is plural. ""All y'all's"" is plural possessive.

-- Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you either.

-- If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" -- stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say.

-- If you see a turn signal blinking on a car with a southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased.

-- Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. They are to be positioned directly in front of one's trailer, since it cost considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be displayed.

-- As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember: many Southerners learned to drive on a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that vehicle.

-- You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find it yourself.";146;;;

Blue Collar;Rules of the Southern Lifestyle;"All good Southerners already know these, but in fairness  to those Yankees who were dumb enough to stay down here:    


1.  Don't order a steak at a Waffle House. They serve breakfast 24 hrs a day, so let them cook something they know.    

2.  Don't laugh at people's names. Merleen, Bodie, Luther Ray, Tammy Ann, Mari Beth, and Inez have all been known to whip a man's ass for less than that.    

3.  Don't order a bottle of pop or a can of soda -- this can lead to a merciless beating. Down South it's called Coke, even if you want a Pepsi.    

4.  Don't show allegiances to any college football squad that isn't an SEC team. All the others are a bunch of candy asses who get to play Wyoming every week.    

5.  Don't refer to Southerner's as a bunch of hillbillies. Many of us are/have been more literate than you (e.g. Welty, Williams, Faulkner), better educated, and generally much nicer to boot.  We've got plenty of business sense (e.g.Turner Broadcasting, MCI WorldCom, MTV, and Netscape). Naturally, we can have lapses of judgment from time to time (e.g. Clinton, Fordice, Duke). We don't care if you think we're dumb, we know better!  

6.  We are fully aware that the humidity is high. Quit your bitching, spend your money, and leave.    

7.  Don't order wheat toast at the Cracker Barrel. If you do this, everyone will know you're from Ohio. Eat the biscuits like God intended and for goodness sake, don't put sugar in your grits.   
8.  Don't attempt to fake a Southern accent.  Nothing will incite a riot faster.    

9.  Don't go around talking about how much better it is back home.  If you don't like it here, take your Yankee ass back home.    

10. We don't play lacrosse, hockey or any of those other sissy ass Northern games, so don't ask about the scores. We...simply...don't...care.    

11. We know how to speak proper English, we talk this way because we want to and we can. It's like playing jazz, you have to know how to do it right first.    

12. Last, but by no means least...DO NOT try to tell us how to Bar-B-Q. This could lead to permanent expulsion and revocation of your work visa.    Consider yourself just damn lucky that we let you come down here in the first place. Don't push your luck!";223;;;

Blue Collar;A Letter From A Redneck Mother To Her Son;"
 

    Dear Son,

    I'm writing this slow 'cause I know you
can't read fast.  We don't live where we did when you left.  Your dad read in
the paper that most accidents happen within twenty miles of home, so we moved. Won't be
able to send you the address as the last Arkansas family that lived here took the numbers
with them for their house, so they wouldn't have to change their address.

    This place has a washing machine. 
The first day I put four shirts in it, pulled the chain and haven't seen 'em since.

    It only rained twice this week, three
days the first time and four days the second time.

    The coat you wanted me to send to you,
Aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with them heavy buttons,
so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.

    We got a bill from the funeral home, and
it said if we didn't make the final payment on Grandma's funderal bill, up she comes.

    About your sister, she had a baby this
morning.  I haven't found out whether if it is a boy or a girl so don't know if you
are an Aunt or Uncle.

    Your Uncle John fell in the whiskey
vat.  Some men tried to get him out, but he fought them off playfully, so he
drowned.  We cremated him and he burned for three days.

    Three of your friends went off the
bridge in a pickup.  One was driving and the other two were in the back.  The
driver got out.  He rolled down the window and swam to safery.  The other 2
drowned.  They couldn't get the tail gate down.

    Not much more news this time. 
Nothing much happened.  If you don't get this letter, please let me know and I will
send another one.

Love, Ma";168;;;

Dirty;A Lesson In Morals;"One day at the end of class, little Johnny's teacher asks the class to go home and think of a story to be concluded with the moral of that story. The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.

Little Suzy raises her hand. ""My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.""
When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""
Little Lucy went next. ""My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken
eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.""
Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.
Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch.""
Next up was little Johnny. ""My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""
The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.
""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""";158;;;

The man says, ""Will you watch us have sexual intercourse?""

The doctor raises both eyebrows, but he is so amazed that such an elderly couple is asking for sexual advice that he agrees.

The next week, however, the couple returns and asks the sex therapist to watch again. The sex therapist is a bit puzzled, but agrees.

This happens several weeks in a row. The couple makes an appointment, has intercourse with no problems, pays the doctor, then leave.
 
Finally, after 5 or 6 weeks of this routine, the doctor says, ""I'm sorry, but I have to ask. Just what are you trying to find out?""

Doctor;The Amazing Health Computer;"One day, Jeffrey complained to his friend, ""My elbow really hurts, I guess I should see a doctor.""
 
""Don't do that! There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything, quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.""

Jeffery figured he had nothing to lose, so he took his urine sample to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:


  “You have tennis elbow.

  Soak your arm in warm water.

  Avoid heavy lifting.

  It will be better in two weeks.”


    Late that evening while thinking how
amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter.  To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.

    He went back to the drug store, located
the machine, poured in the sample and deposited $10.00. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:


  “Your tap water is too hard.

  Get a water softener.

  

  Your dog has worms.

  Get him vitamins.

  

  Your daughter's using cocaine.

  Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.

  

  Your wife's pregnant - twin girls.

  They aren't yours.

  Get a lawyer.
  And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will

At this the man pulls off his oxygen mask and asks again,

And then on the count of three we'll both rush out at each other and then it will just happen in the middle of the bedroom.''    The wife is a bit unsure about this, but since she doesn't have any better ideas she agrees. 

So, the husband goes into the closet and the wife goes into the bathroom and they both get undressed.    The anticipation is driving the husband mad and as he takes off his clothes he gets an enormous erection. The wife turns off the lights and on the count of three they both rush into the bedroom towards each other. But since the room is dark the husband gets disoriented and runs by his wife — right into the dresser. He hits the dresser so hard that he passes out from the pain.

The deacon motions to a pad and pen on the nightstand. The preacher hands his friend the pad and pen, and the deacon begins to write. Suddenly, the deacon dies.

At his funeral, the preacher delivers the service. He says, ""I was with him when he died, and as a matter of fact, I have his last thought in my coat pocket here.""

The preacher pulls out the paper and reads, ""Please, get up. You're kneeling on my oxygen hose.""";60;;;

God;Some Character;"Where do the characters go when I use my backspace or delete them on my PC?  

ANSWER: The characters go to different places, depending on whom you ask:

The Buddhist explanation: If a character has lived rightly, and its karma  is good, then after it has been deleted it will be reincarnated as a different, higher character. Those funny characters above the numbers on  your keyboard will become numbers, numbers will become letters, and lower-case letters will become upper-case. 

The 20th-century bitter cynical nihilist explanation: Who cares? It doesn't really matter if they're on the page, deleted, undeleted, underlined, etc. It's all the same. 

The Mac user's explanation: All the characters written on a PC and then  deleted go to straight to PC hell. If you're using a PC, you can probably see the deleted characters, because you're in PC hell also. 

Stephen King's explanation: Every time you hit the (Del) key you unleash a tiny monster inside the cursor, who tears the poor, unsuspecting characters to shreds, drinks their blood, then eats them, bones and all.  Hah, hah, hah! 

The Christian Church's approach to characters: The nice characters go to  Heaven, where they are bathed in the light of happiness. The naughty characters are punished for their sins. Naughty characters are those involved in the creation of naughty words, such as ""breast,"" ""sex,"" and contraception."" 

Dave Barry's explanation: The deleted characters are shipped to Battle Creek, Michigan, where they're made into Pop-Tart filling; this explains why Pop-Tarts are so flammable, while cheap imitations are not flammable.  I'm not making this up. 

IBM's explanation: The characters are not real. They exist only on the screen when they are needed, as concepts, so to delete them is merely to de-conceptualize them. Get a life. 

PETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) explanation: You've  been DELETING them??? Can't you hear them SCREAMING??? Why don't you go CLUB some BABY SEALS while wearing a MINK, you pig!!!!";202;;;

The father, having never seen an elevator, responded, ""I have no idea what it is.""   
  
While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady in a wheelchair rolled up to the moving walls and pressed a button.

The walls opened up again and a beautiful twenty-four-year-old woman stepped out.    
     
The father looked at his son anxiously and said, ""Go get your mother.""";81;;;

God;Jesus and Satan are having a conversation...;"Jesus and Satan were having an ongoing argument about who was better on his computer. They had been going at it for days, and God was tired of hearing all of the bickering.

Finally God said, ""Cool it. I am going to set up a test that will run two hours and I will judge who does the better job.""

So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away. They moused. They did spreadsheets. They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail. They sent out e-mail with attachments. They downloaded. They did some genealogy reports. They made cards. They did every known job. But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.

Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed. The electricity finally flickered back on and each of them restarted their computers.

Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!""

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate.

""Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?""

God shrugged and said, ""Jesus saves.""";126;;;

6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is  satisfied that play is completed.  Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.
7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the  hole immediately upon arrival at the course.  The  experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special attention to well-formed bunkers.
8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played, or are currently  playing, to the owner of the course being  played.  Angry course owners have been known to damage players' equipment for this reason.
9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.
10. Players should ensure that the match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time.  Previous players have been known to  become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course.
11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.  Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair.  Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play when this is the case.
12.  The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush around the hole to allow for improved viewing of alignment with, and approach to the hole.
13. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to play the back nine.
14. Slow play is encouraged.  However, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request.
15.  It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.";227;;;

Gross;The Fly;"From an article in the Wall Street Journal, about the Dutch firm that has been hired to manage the International Arrivals Building at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport:

The tile under the urinals in the Arrivals Building has that familiar lemony tinge; rubber soles stick to it. Over in Amsterdam, the tile under Schiphol's urinals would pass inspection in an operating room. But nobody notices. What everybody does notice is that each urinal has a fly in it. Look harder, and the fly turns into the black outline of a fly, etched into the porcelain.

""It improves the aim,"" says Aad Kieboom. ""If a man sees a fly, he aims at it."" Mr. Kieboom, an economist, directs Schiphol's own building expansion. His staff conducted fly-in-urinal trials and found that etchings reduce spillage by 80%. The Dutch will transfer the technology to New York.

""We will put flies in the urinals yes,"" Jan Jansen says in a back office at the Arrivals Building. He is the new Dutch general manager, the boss as of noon today. ""It gives a guy something to think about. That's the perfect example of process control.""

But a spokesperson for Rudy Guiliani, Mayor of New York, was heard to say, ""What do we need with Dutch flies when we have more than enough roaches to piss on?""";126;;;

She tells her daughter to get up earlier than everyone else and don't say a thing, go make breakfast and then brush her teeth while the others are eating.  The young woman thinks and then runs off to get ready for the wedding, happy.      

The couple is married and they are happy, him with his perpetual socks and her with her morning silences.  One morning about 5:30 am the young man wakes up to find one sock missing.

Kids;Greg Giraldo: Dodgeball Skills;Part of growing up is learning your strengths and weaknesses.

Kids;Things I've Learned from My Children;"1. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes. 

2. A 3-year-old is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant.

3. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite. 
4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42-pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of a large room. 

5. When using the ceiling fan as a baseball bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. 

6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit by a ceiling fan. 

7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words ""Uh-oh,"" it's already too late. 

8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. 

9. A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying glass can start a fire even on an overcast day. 

10. Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a six-year-old. 

11. ""Play-Doh"" and ""microwave"" should never be used in the same sentence. 

12. Super glue is forever. 

13. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't walk on water. 

14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O. 

15. VCRs do not eject PB&J sandwiches even though TV commercials show they do. 

16. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house 4 inches deep. 

17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise in a moving car. 

18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is. 

19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not like ovens. 

20. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms dizzy. It will, however, make cats dizzy. 

21. Cats spit up twice their body weight when dizzy.";188;;;

Marriage;Lisa Landry: Spicing Up the Sex Life;I told him, 'You are not bringing home a hooker. That is inappropriate. I can't have that.' There's no way I'm gonna watch my husband have sex with another woman, right in front of me, and then she gets paid cash for it -- and then she gets to leave! I don't think so, hooker. You're gonna sit down and listen to him talk for half an hour.;34;;;

Marriage;Corey Holcomb: Ask for What You Want;I know how it is -- you're too scared to ask for what you want. You take a girl out, spend all your money, get that little kiss on the cheek at the end of the night. That never happens to me. I ask for sex when I show up at the door for the date.;25;;;

'I don't care' equals 'whatever you want, honey, I love you.' It's all in there, but women are crazy. Things go in here and get all scrambled up.

Miscellaneous;Drinking Game: Big Lebowski;"The way this game works is every time the word f**k is used (in any form, ex. f**king, f**ker, etc.), or the word dude (in any form, ex. ""his dudeliness, the dudester, etc.) is used, you take a drink. If you've seen the movie, you'll know that after five minutes of playing, you should be dialing 9-1-1. The main character's name is ""Dude"" and swearing, especially with the f-word, is quite excessive. Because both dude and f**k are used so much during the movie that we altered the rules to include that you can choose to only drink when one or the other word is said. 

I can promise you this: Playing this game makes the movie make a lot more sense.";65;;;

The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are waiting for instructions.  
The two Australian men beat each other senseless fighting  over the Australian woman, who called them both “bloody wankers” and is checking out all the other men.
Both New Zealand men are searching the island for sheep.

The man is at least six feet four, has a huge red beard and, despite the wind, mist, and near freezing temperatures, is  wearing only his kilt, a tweed shirt and a tam-o''-shanter at a rakish angle. 

At the roadside there also stands a young woman. She is absolutely beautiful -- slim,  shapely, fair complexion, golden hair... heart stopping.  The driver stops and stares, and his attention is only distracted from the lovely girl when the red thing opens the car door and drags him from his seat onto the road with a fist resembling a whole raw ham.  

''''Right, you Jimmy,'''' he shouts, ''''Ah want you to masturbate!''''  

''''But......'''' stammers the driver.  

''''Du it now - or I''ll bluddy kill yu!''''  

So the driver turns his back on the girl, drops his trousers and starts to masturbate.  Thinking of the girl on the roadside, this doesn''t take him long.  

''''Right!'''' snarls the Highlander ''''Du it agin, now!''''  

So the driver does it again.  ''''Right laddie, du it agin!'''' demands the Highlander.  

This goes on for nearly two hours. The hapless driver gets cramps in both arms, he  has rubbed himself raw, is violently aching, his sight is failing and despite the cold wind, he has collapsed in a sweating, jibbering heap on the ground, unable to stand.

''''Du it again!'''' says the Highlander. 

''''I can''t do it any more - you''ll just have to kill me!'''' whimpers the man.  

The Highlander looks down at the pathetic soul slumped on the roadside and says, ''''All right laddie. NOW, can you give ma daughter a lift to Inverness?''''";175;;;

Just before the meal, the President noticed the cook sticking his fingers in the soup to taste it and again he complained to the chief of staff about the cook, but he was told that this man was supposed to be a very good chef. The meal went okay, but the President was sure that the soup tasted a little off and by the time dessert came, he was starting to have stomach cramps and nausea. It was getting worse and worse 'til finally he had to excuse himself from the state dinner to look for the bathroom. 

Passing through the kitchen, he caught sight of the cook, Jon, scratching his rear end and this made him feel even worse. By now he was desperately ill with violent cramps and was so disorientated that he couldn't remember which door led to the bathroom. He was on the verge of passing out from the pain when he finally found a door that opened and as he undid his trousers and ran in, he realized to his horror that he had stumbled into Monica Lewinsky's office with his trousers around his knees. As he was just about to pass out, she bent over him and heard her president whisper in a barely audible voice, “sack my cook.” 
And that is how the whole misunderstanding occurred.";155;;;

News & Politics;The Fish-Eating Competition;"One day some fisherman caught tons of fish called tench.  The fisherman couldn''t eat them all so they gave them to the Mayor of the town.  The Mayor wasn''t sure what to do with them.  Then he had an idea; he would have a fish-eating competition.  

When they had the competition, there were two finalists: a man from a place called Fife, whose name was Mr. Hicks; and a man that was from Sweden, whose name is Sven.  
So they had the final; the Mayor fired the starting pistol and they started eating the tench.  No sooner had Mr. Hicks bitten the fish than one of his teeth fell out.  He couldn''t eat because of this so he stopped, but the Mayor refused to stop the competition.  So Sven kept on eating and ended up eating nine of these tench fish. 


The next day the headlines read:  ONE TOOTH FREE FOR FIFE HICKS, SVEN ATE NINE TENCH!";84;;;

Well, guess what? About 10 minutes later, Ian sneezed again and proceeded as before. She turned to Ian and said, ""That is disgusting! Must you do that in front of me?""  Ian apologized and explained that it was a medical condition, ""Every time I sneeze, I have an orgasm,"" he explained.

congregation in a little Pennsylvania town. One day, he was walking down Main Street and
he happened to notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar,
drinking beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of his
congregation should do. He walked through the open door of the bar and sat down next to
the woman.

sternly. ""This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don't you let me take
you home?""

weave back and forth. The reverend realized that she had had too much to drink and he
grabbed hold of her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and
tumbled to the floor. After rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying
on top of Mrs. Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.

    The bartender looked over the bar and said,
""Here, here, buddy, we won't have any of that carrying on in this bar.""

Police & Military;Sailors and Soldiers Should Be Friends!;"A Navy man and an Army man are driving opposite directions on a curvy mountain road.  The army  man hits a patch of sand, swerves, and nails the Navy man's truck.  They both exit their cars with no injuries, but their vehicles are ruined.

Now, the rivalry between Army and Navy is well known, so needless to say a heated argument followed. Then suddenly the Navy man changed heart and said, ""Hold on, this is dumb. It was an accident. Let's put this rivalry behind us.""

The Army man agreed this was a good idea. So the Navy man offered, ""Why don't we celebrate our new friendship over a fifth of vodka? I have a bottle in the truck.""  

The Army man thought this was an excellent idea. So the Navy man, being a gentleman, offered  the Army man the first drink, and told the Army man to drink as much as he wanted.  Soon half the bottle was gone and he offered the bottle back to the Navy man who said, ""Thanks, but I'll wait till after the cops get here!""";96;;;

So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting. He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home. He offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc... 
The cabbie said, ''If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!'' 
So the businessman was forced to hitchhike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight.       
 One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. 
The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan.       
 The businessman got in the first cab in the line, ''How much for a ride to the airport,'' he asked?
 ''Fifteen bucks,'' came the reply.
 ''And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?''
 ''What?! Get the hell out of my cab.''   
    The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result.
 When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked, ''How much for a ride to the airport?'' 
The cabbie replied, ''Fifteen bucks.'' 
The businessman said, ''OK,'' and off they went.       Then, as they drove slowly past the long line of cabs, the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each of the other drivers.";196;;;

""What is your sin, my child?"" The priest asks back.

""Well,"" the man starts, ""I used some horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible.""

""Is that when you swore?""

""No, Father."" Said the man.

Is THAT when you swore?"" asked the Father again.

""Well, no."" said the man, ""You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!""

""Is THAT when you swore?"" asked the amazed Priest.

""No, not yet."" The man replied. ""As the eagle carried the squirrel away in his claws, it flew  towards the green. And as it passed over a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball.""

""Did you swear THEN?"" asked the now impatient Priest.

""Granted!"" said the fairy, who turned him yellow. Unfortunately, his little toady penis was still yellow. 

""What about my penis?"" he asked the fairy. 

""Oh! For that, you'll have to go see the wizard."" And so the toad hopped off to find the wizard. Soon, a pink elephant visited the fairy, and he wished to be turned gray. She granted him the wish, but, as with the toad, his penis was still pink. So she told him to visit the wizard.

""How do I find the wizard?"" he asked.

""Just follow the yellow d**k toad.""";80;;;

  $ Michael Jordan having ""retired,""
  with $40 million in endorsements, makes $178,100 a day, working or not.
  $ If he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes
  $52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head.
  $ If he goes to see a movie, it'll cost him
  $7.00, but he'll make $18,550 while he's there.
  $ If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll
  make $618 while boiling it.
  $ He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage.
  $ He'll make $3,710 while watching each
  episode of Friends.
  $ If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX
  ($90,000) it would take him a whole 12 hours.
  $ If someone were to hand him his salary and
  endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second.
  $ He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice
  round of golf, but will be reimbursed $33,390 for that round.
  $ Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15%
  of his income into a tax deferred account (401k), his contributions will hit the federal
  cap of $9500 at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st.
  $ If you were given a penny for every 10

  $20 for a meal in his trendy Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about $5600.
  $ This year, he'll make more than twice as

The story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached. The following was actually turned in by two of my  English students, Rebecca [last name deleted] and Gary [last name
deleted.] ""

At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile.  But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl.  His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again.  So chamomile was out of the question.

Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago.  ""A.S. Harris to Geostation 17,"" he said into his transgalactic communicator.  ""Polar orbit established.  No sign of resistance so far..."" But before he could sign off, a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay.  The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.

He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him.  Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4. ""Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel,"" Laurie read in her newspaper one morning.  The news simultaneously excited  her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth  -- when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her.  ""Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?"" she pondered wistfully.

Little did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live.  Thousands of miles above the city, the Au'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles.  The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless  target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet.  With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85 million other Americans.  The President slammed his fist on the conference table. ""We can't allow this!  I'm going to veto that treaty! Let's blow'em out of the sky!""

School;Survival of the Fittest Brain Cells;"    A herd of buffalo can only move as fast
as the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at
the back of the herd that are killed first.  This natural selection is good for the
herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole herd is maintained or
even improved by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the
human brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through which the
electrical signals pass. 

Recent emiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.   Thus, regular consumption of spirits helps eliminate the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. The result of this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of completing university
studies and then getting married and settling down, most professionals cannot keep up with
the performance of the new graduates.  Only those few that stick to the strict
regimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that they
achieved during their university years.

    So, this is a call to arms.  As our
country is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes.  But get
back into the bars  and pubs and quaff that pint!  Your company and your country
needs you to be at your peak, and at your best, and you shouldn't deny yourself the career
opportunities that you could achieve through excessive alcohol consumption.  Take
life by the bottle and be all that you can be! And remember a good  cold beer will
kill those bad, useless brain cells that are slowing you  down and it will make the
necessary room needed to get the good brain cells up front and at the top ready to perform
at their best.  So bottoms up, down  the hatch, look out brain it's coming fast!";203;;;

School;Chemistry, Duke and Bonkistry;"Introductory Chemistry at Duke has been taught for about a zillion years by Professor Bonk (really), and his course is semi-affectionately known as ""Bonkistry"". He has been around forever, so I wouldn't put it past him to come up with something like this.

Anyway, one year there were these two guys who were taking Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the mid-terms and labs, etc., such that going into the final they had a solid A. These friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem final was on Monday), they decided to go up to U Virginia and party with some friends up there.

They did this and had a great time.  However, with their hangovers and everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor Bonk after the final and explained to him why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to UVA for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back to campus. 

Bonk thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were elated, relieved and very proud of their story. So, they studied that night and went in the next day at the time Bonk had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin.

They looked at the first problem, which was something simple about molarity and solutions and was worth 5 points. ""Cool,"" they thought, ""this is going to be easy."" They did that problem and turned the page. They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on the next page...

9) Move everything to one side of the room.  Ask your roommate if he       knows how much an elephant weighs, and look at the floor on the       empty side of the room with concern.  

8) Draw a tiny black line on your nose.  Make it bigger every day.        Look at it and say, ''The hair, it's growing. Growing!''

If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be intersted in a job teaching others. We can add your name to our BASIC UNDERSTANDING LECTURE LIST (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).

For students who are attending to pursue a carrier in management and consultancy, we will refer you to the department of MANAGERIAL OPERATIONAL RESEARCH EDUCATION (M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.). This course emphasizes on how to manage M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.

MARKETING: You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and socializing, which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least compatible with Sales.

SALES: Laziest of all signs, often referred to as ""marketing without a degree,"" you are also self-centered and paranoid.

You seek admiration for your golf game throughout your life.

TECHNOLOGY: Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are  instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace. Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying, but who the hell can tell?! It is written that the geeks shall inherit the Earth.

ENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all personal ads are placed by engineers. You can be happy with yourself: your office is typically full of all the latest ""ergodynamic"" gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your ""carpal tunnel""...

ACCOUNTING: The only other sign that studied in school, you are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the  majority of rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane.

HUMAN RESOURCES: Ironically, given your access to confidential information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization.

Technology;An elderly lady phoned her telephone company;"An elderly lady phoned her telephone company to report that her telephone failed to ring when her friends called - and that on the few occasions when it did ring, her pet dog always moaned right before the phone rang. The telephone repairman proceeded to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog or senile elderly lady.

He climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned loudly and the telephone began to ring.

Climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:

1. The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire via a steel chain and collar. 

2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.

3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the phone number was called.

4. After a couple of such jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate on himself and the ground.

5. The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phone 
to ring.


Which demonstrates that some problems CAN be fixed by pissing and 
moaning.";107;;;

He enrolled in a technical institute that specialized in teaching auto mechanics.
He aced the course, but the final exam required each student to completely strip and reassemble an engine. It was with some trepidation that he took the test. At completion, he turned the engine over to his instructors for evaluation and awaited his final grade. 
When they were handed out, he did a double take at the 150% grade he received.
Rather confused, he asked his instructors how it was possible to have a grade like this. ""It is really quite simple,"" they said. ""We gave you 50% for correctly disassembling the engine, 50% for correctly reassembling it, and an additional 50% for doing it all through the muffler.""";113;;;

They made me take the dog out of the carrier, so they could inspect it for explosives. Who bombs a f**king puppy? Really, who does that? Bin Laden would be like, 'You're a dick, dude. I can't believe you -- that's too far.';30;;;
Travel & Car;Peter Johansson: Customs Security Search;When customs finds something in your butt, how do you act surprised?;7;;;

Travel & Car;Paul Provenza: Tricked-Out Condoms;The condoms, they got ribs and spikes and studs. Sometimes, they get a little carried away. You look at it and go, 'Are we having sex or driving through a snowy mountain road?';18;;;
Travel & Car;DL Hughley: New York City Difference;New York -- I dig it, I dig it. A lot of differences here. Like, in California, if someone crosses the street, we'll stop.;12;;;
Travel & Car;Tom Rhodes: English Food;Food is terrible in England. That's no joke. If you go there, don't even bring a change of clothes -- wear what you got on and bring a suitcase full of sandwiches.;16;;;
Travel & Car;Jim Gaffigan: Writing Postcards;You could be a genius -- you try to write a postcard, you come across like a moron anyway. It's always like, 'This city's got big buildings. I like food. Bye.';16;;;
Travel & Car;"John Ferrentino: Watching ""Alive""";I saw the movie 'Alive.' Did you see that movie? The movie where the plane crashes, and they eat each other to stay alive? And I'm thinking, 'Hey, this is one movie they won't be showing on the airlines.' No, not because the planes crashes, but the fact that the people in the movie are eating better than the people on the plane.;33;;;
Travel & Car;Sabrina Matthews: Airplane Safety Guide;They can get rid of page three, that's the water landing section. There is no useful information there. At the top, they show you how to use your seat-bottom cushion as a flotation device. I don't want to present myself as a genius, but if I am drowning and something is floating, I will figure out how to operate it.;32;;;
Travel & Car;Tracy Smith: Carry on the Name;My brother has two daughters -- disappointed he doesn't have a son to carry on his name. I said, 'Jerry, our name is Smith. Wake the hell up -- our name's being carried on in hotel rooms all over the country.';21;;;

Travel & Car;Louis Ramey: First Sexual Experience;"I remember my first sexual experience: back seat of my dad's car. I was young; I was in love; I was alone. No, not quite -- Dad was driving. He was pissed. It's a small car, and the top was down.";20;;;
Travel & Car;Sandra Bernhard: On Breast Implants;They leak, you know, once you get them in there. Sometimes they leak the fluid out which is lovely. And then you can't fly in the Concorde because they explode. So, forget going to the moon or Paris -- course, they're both the same, so you know. Just stay at home if you have breast implants or just stay at low altitudes.;32;;;
Travel & Car;John Caparulo: Missouri;I don't know if you've looked at your state lately -- it sucks, alright? There's just cold and cows and stuff. I'm trying to get up to 88 miles an hour so I can get back to 1985, bitch.;18;;;
Travel & Car;Victor Varnado: Things a Black Albino Can Do;Another thing I do most black people don't do -- catch cabs. I love it. I can catch as many cabs as I want. They don't even know I'm black until I hop in the back and I'm like, 'To Compton!' 'But, that's all the way across country.' 'I know, and we're robbing stores on the way!';28;;;

Travel & Car;Anthony Clark: Friendly in Ireland;I don't know if you've ever been to Ireland. They are really the nicest people on the face of the earth. You do a show there, you walk into the pub in Ireland -- you have five best friends immediately. I walk into the bar, the first guy I see goes, 'Tell me something.' I'm like, 'Alright.' He goes, 'If you woke up in the morning and there were grass stains on your knees and a condom hanging out of your butt, would you tell anyone?' I'm like, 'Nope. I don't think so. No.' He goes, 'Would you like to go camping with me, laddy?';53;;;
Travel & Car;Joe Bolster: Calling a Car Phone;I called a car phone the other day for the first time. I did something I thought was kind of stupid, considering my friend never answered and I was calling a car. Think about this -- I let the phone ring 11 times. Did I think perhaps my friend was in another part of the vehicle? He's going to pick up the phone out of breath -- 'Sorry, came in from the trunk. Man, I have got to get a cordless. One phone is not enough for this Chevette.';44;;;
Travel & Car;Tony Woods: Didn't Go to Africa-Africa;I mean, I didn't go to Africa-Africa like you're thinking, but I smoked a joint and watched the Discovery Channel. It is the same thing. I was right there in the jungle.;17;;;
Travel & Car;Sebastian Maniscalco: Airport Dress Code;What is going on at the airport? Could we put a dress code at the airport? It looks like a slumber party over there. Do people care what they look like anymore? They just come out now as-is. They must roll out of bed, and then they're at United.;24;;;
Travel & Car;Eugene Mirman: Poorest Neighborhood in North America;I was in Vancouver, and I was in what I was told was the poorest neighborhood in North America -- which I find very hard to believe because has anyone here ever been to Detroit?;18;;;
Travel & Car;Deon Cole: Visiting Texas;They put me in a Mexican Super 8, called the Grande Ocho. Everything in my room was chained down. I couldn't even pull my sheets back.;13;;;
Travel & Car;Wanda Sykes: African American Roots;Some black people want to get in touch with their African roots -- that's what they want to do, try and find their African roots. But then you got some black people that just don't give a damn. You tell them, 'Hey, I just got back from the mother land.' They're like, 'Where'd you go -- Detroit? Did you see the Temptations?';32;;;
Travel & Car;Shane Mauss: Imaginary Increments;I don't like when I ask someone for directions and they give me imaginary increments of distance. Like, 'Oh yeah, it's just a hop and a skip.';14;;;
Travel & Car;Louis C.K.: New York City Subways;I've been living in this city for 15 years -- I have no idea where the train is going. I never know. You can't go by the dot on the side 'cause that's meaningless. They change it. You get on, the guy's like, 'This is V Train, but we're not making local stops, and we don't know where we're going, so just get the hell off the train! Everybody off the train! This is no longer a train!';38;;;

I look over at the side of the road, and there's a hitchhiker with a sign and it says, 'Pick me up, and you can drive in the carpool lane.' I got to tell you, he was kind of smelly, but he was a good conversationalist.;29;;;
Travel & Car;Richard Lewis: All First Class Flight;They flew me out in this plane that was only first class. It was all first class. It was the most psychotic thing I've ever seen in my life. The drinking that went on -- it was like Mardi Gras. The nose of the plane started to develop red veins.;24;;;
Travel & Car;Al Madrigal: Backstage at the Mexican Strip Club;So I go back, reluctantly, down a murky hallway to what looks like a Dollar Store dressing room, and I open up the dirty curtain. There's a velvet Elvis on the wall with the eyes cut out -- some weird sort of quality assurance program they're running in there. They got a dirty recliner they pulled off the street with duct tape on it -- God knows what else. They got a bloody pipe on the floor. It's like a third world game of Clue.;43;;;
Travel & Car;Ardal O'Hanlon: Making Friends With the Flight Attendant;She said, 'Where are you from?' And I said I was Irish. And she said to me, 'Oh you're Irish, are you? You'll be needing this.' And she left the drinks trolley down beside me.;18;;;

Travel & Car;Margaret Smith: Seatbelts;Safety was not a big thing when I was growing up. A seatbelt was something that got in the way. I'd be like, 'Ma, this seatbelt's digging into my back.' 'Well, stuff it down into the seat. What are you, mental? Roll those windows up. You're letting the smoke out.';26;;;

Travel & Car;Jon Dore: Closest to Home;I read an article that said, 'Car accidents happen closest to home.' Does that mean that orphans are better drivers? No, if you think about it, it makes sense. 'Cause they'd have more time to practice when they're not being loved by anyone.;24;;;
Travel & Car;Jasper Reed: Car Horns;I think car horns should sound like gunshots 'cause the sound of a horn is not representin' my road rage properly. I've never been angry with someone and had the urge to toot a trumpet.;18;;;
Travel & Car;Greg Proops: Best-Looking Person in England;I like to go to England, and I'll tell you why. I like to go to a country where I am considered the best-looking person. It's as simple as that. Hollywood, kind of a crushing ego blow -- 'Hey Buddy Holly, you are so old, have you not perished in a plane crash?' But not in England, good God, not there. In England, God bless that dinky island, there it's, 'Good God, look at him. He has all his teeth and his ears are in proportion to his head.' I'm Brad bloody Pitt on that island.;48;;;

Travel & Car;Jon Ross: My Brother's Rare Trick;My brother just got married. I went to the wedding in Israel, where he lives. He lives there because he's studying to become a rabbi.

Travel & Car;Old Joe;"A farmer is in the middle of plowing his field when his tractor runs out of gas. He needs to get back to the farm, but it's too far for him and his dog, Old Joe, to walk.

He wanders out to the road and flags down a sports car. The driver says, ""I'll give you a ride, but that dog can't get in my car.""

The farmer says, ""Don't worry. Old Joe will keep up.""

The driver decides to show off and open up the engine for max speed. Just as he's going into fifth gear, he looks out the window and sees Old Joe right beside him. In amazement, he slams on the brakes and Old Joe comes to a halt.

The driver jumps out, exclaiming, ""He's the most incredible dog I've ever seen! Is there something special about that collar he's wearing?""

The farmer shakes his head and says, ""That's not a collar. That's his a**hole. He's not used to stopping that fast.""";85;;;
Travel & Car;Speeding Old Chicks;"A state trooper spied a car puttering along at 22 MPH.  So he turned on his lights and pulled the driver over. Approaching the car, he noticed that five old ladies were inside, and they looked wide-eyed and terribly pale.

The driver pleaded with him, ""Officer, I don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to be the problem?"" 

""Ma'am,"" the officer replies, ""You weren't speeding, but driving slower than the speed limit can also be dangerous.""
 
""I beg to differ, sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly:  twenty-two miles an hour!"" the old woman said. 

The State Police officer, chuckling, explained to her that ""22"" was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. 

""But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car ok? These women seem awfully shaken,"" the officer asked.

""Oh, they'll be all right in a minute officer. We just got off Route 119.""";98;;;

""No, sir,"" the drunk answers. ""We haven't had a thing to drink tonight.""

""Then what on earth are those beer labels doing on your foreheads?""

""We're both alcoholics,"" says the drunk. ""We're on the patch.""";55;;;

Travel & Car;Tony Stone: Cool Pilot;"We were flying into San Francisco. There was a lot of turbulence; everybody started freaking out. The pilot was cool.

We've asked the stewardesses to go ahead and cancel some of those car reservations for you. Please feel free to get up and move around the cabin, or smoke. I don't think it makes much difference at this point. You people on the right are going to get a real nice view of the bay coming up there pretty quick.

And they have, like, little drawings: circle, line through it, 'No!' One of the things you can't bring on the plane anymore is a bomb -- no, no, they had a picture, can't do it.

Uh-uh, not so fast -- they also had a picture of the bundle of dynamite with the clock.;56;;;
Travel & Car;Bill Engvall: School Buses Create Grouchy Old Men;And, see, all this stuff is turning me into this guy I don't want to be: that grouchy old, get-off-my-yard guy. Remember that guy? He was like 'Ah get off my yard! I hate everyone. I hate kids'. It's making me this grouchy guy and I don't want to be it. But I'll give you a great example. The other day, I was in my car and I got stuck behind a school bus. Now, I don't know if you've been stuck behind a school bus before, but once you're there, you're stuck. I've passed kidney stones quicker than you can get around a school bus.;53;;;

There were some girls up in a balcony. A chant goes up: 'Show your tits.' I joined the chant because I support the cause. The girls show 'em, we threw up some beads -- I figured that's the end of the transaction. Turns out they reciprocate with a chant of their own: 'We want c**k.' What do you do? Turns out, I had some c**k on me -- unfasten, unbutton, unzip -- beads showering down on me. Best moment of my entire life -- cut short: handcuffed, thrown against the wall. My friend runs off, but manages to get a picture before he does. I don't know a lot about prison, but I do know, handcuffed, with your pants down, covered in beads, is not a good way to arrive.;79;;;

He's doing that thing that some black guys have done to me in the past: they think that because I'm not black they can be aggressive and yell at me, and I'll be scared and intimidated and back off.

And it's fine for the person in the front, and when it turns green, that guy never seems to go -- I don't know why. I don't know if it's the power: knowing there are people behind them, and they're controlling people's lives? And the psychology is interesting 'cause the guy in the number two spot, he won't honk 'cause he figures, 'Hey, I'm getting through.' But the further back you get, the more tense it becomes... So I'm in sixth. I honk. The guy in front of me flips me off. I'm like, 'What? I'm not even honking at you -- I'm looping around you.';76;;;

Now, personally, I think that it's sad enough that I'm sitting alone in a hotel room watching porn. They really don't need to introduce that whole element of shame into it. I mean, they might as well say, 'Movie titles will not appear on your screen, you sick, sick bastard.';56;;;

Work;Rules For Work;"
1.  Never give me work in the morning.
  Always wait until 4:00 and then bring it to me.  The challenge of a deadline
is refreshing.
2.  If it's really a rush job, run in and
interrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going.  That helps.  Or even
better, hover behind me, advising me at every keystroke.
3.  Always leave without telling anyone
where you're going.  It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you
are.
4.  If my arms are full of papers, boxes,
books, or supplies, don't open the door for me.  I need to learn how to function as a
paraplegic and opening doors with no arms is good training in case I should ever be
injured and lose all use of my limbs.
5.  If you give me more than one job to
do, don't tell me which is priority.  I am psychic.
6.  Do your best to keep me late.  I
adore this office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do.  I have no life
beyond work.
7.  If a job I do pleases you, keep it a
secret.  If that gets out, it could mean a promotion.
8.  If you don't like my work, tell
everyone.  I like my name to be popular in conversations.  I was born to be
whipped.
9.  If you have special instructions for
a job, don't write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done.  No
use confusing me with useful information.
10.  Never introduce me to the people
you're with.  I have no right to know anything.  In the corporate food chain, I
am plankton.  When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them.
11.  Be nice to me only when the job I'm
doing for you could really change your life and send you straight to managers' hell.
12.  Tell me all your little problems.
  No one else has any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate.  I
especially like the story about having to pay so much taxes on the bonus check you
received for being such a good manager.
13.  Wait until my yearly review and THEN
tell me what my goals SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating
  with a cost of living increase. I'm not here for the money anyway.";208;;;

After examining the products, he hadn't found an appropriately amazing vibrator and asked the store clerk for help. The store clerk recommended the ""Voodoo D**k."" 

""How does it work?"" asked the businessman. 

The clerk unwrapped the Voodoo D**k from its ceremonial tiki box and said to it, ""Voodoo D**k that door."" The vibrator flew out of the box and attacked the door with such vigor that the door split in half.

He instructed his wife on how to use the Voodoo D**k and left on his business trip. Soon, his wife decided to try it out and said the magic words: ""Voodoo D**k my p***y."" 

The Voodoo D**k flew out of the box and gave her orgasm after orgasm. But soon it became too much, and she couldn't figure out how to make it stop. So she got into her car and began driving to the hospital, swerving so much that she got pulled over by the police.

Work;Workplace Farting: Options Explored;"Whether the cause is a previous night of drinking or a big lunch, the outcome is the same: Farts. 

Seventy percent of the time, we can dispense freely. The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions. 
  
Holders - The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk. 
  
Desk Jockey -  When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider: 

- Do you have your own office? Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. I also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females. 

- Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk? If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area. If it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days. There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heal on the floor. I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event. 
 
Meetings: - Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time. Meetings and gas really do not mix. Releasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in. Although I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it. It really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting. This will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected. Warning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline. Of course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. You have free reign to do whatever you like. 
 
Aisle Walker: - Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option. By the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident. The added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice. 
 
Broom Closet: - One option is to find a broom closet and release inside the closet. The only drawback is explaining why you were in the broom closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet.

The children came in to breakfast and didn't say a word.    

When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet, said, “Good morning boss, Happy Birthday.”  And I felt a little better; someone had remembered. 

I worked until noon. Then Janet knocked on my door and said, “You know, it's such a beautiful day outside and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me.” I said, “By George, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go.” 

We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go; we went out into the country to a little private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. 

On the way back to the office, she said, “You know, it's such a beautiful day. We don't need to go back to the office, do we?” I said, “No, I guess not.” She said, “Let's go to my apartment.” After arriving at her apartment she said, “Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable.” 

“Sure,” I excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife, children and dozens of our friends. All were singing “Happy Birthday” and there on the couch I sat... naked.";168;;;
