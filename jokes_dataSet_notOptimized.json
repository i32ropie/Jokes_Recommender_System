He couldn't decide   which son he could send to college, since he could only afford to send one.  \n\nThis farmer also had two ducks.  These ducks were retarded.  They were only two ducks on the farm that weren't normal.  He told his sons that whoever could get the most money for the duck would go to college.  \n\nThe sons   went out in attempt to collect as much money as   they could.    The first son was walking down the street when he passed a man working in the yard.  The man asked him if the duck was for sale, for the man loved the taste of ducks.  He offered the son 10 dollars for his duck.  The son decided this was very good, so he took it.  He decided his brother wouldn't be able to get close to his success.\n\nThe second son was walking and passed a whorehouse.  He went in and said that he didn't have any money, but he would give them the duck.  One girl said fine. After they f**ked, she decided that she didn't want the duck anymore.  The son said he would take the duck back if they f**ked again.  She agreed.  After they f**ked the second time, the son left.  \n\nHe was walking home, thinking about what to do with the duck when it broke the leash.  The duck ran out into the street and was hit by a car.  The lady that hit it jumped from her car and started apologizing profusely.  The son insisted it was ok, but the lady said she would pay for the duck.  She was in a hurry, so she gave him 25 dollars and sped off.   \n\nWhen the sons got home, the farmer asked the first son what he got.  He proudly displayed the 10 dollars.  The farmer was impressed.  He asked the second son the same thing.  \n\n\"That's nothing.  I got a f**k for a duck, a duck for a f**k, and 25 dollars for a f**ked up duck.",

Each church was overrun with pesky squirrels. \n                             \nOne day, the Presbyterian Church called a meeting to decide what to do about the squirrels. After much prayer and consideration they determined that the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will. \n        \nIn the Baptist Church the squirrels had taken up habitation in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a cover on the baptistery and drown the squirrels in it. The squirrels escaped somehow and there were twice as many there the next week.  \n        \nThe Methodist Church got together and decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creation. So, they humanely trapped the Squirrels and set them free a few miles outside of town. Three days later, the squirrels were back. \n         \nBut -- The Catholic Church came up with the best and most effective solution. They baptized the squirrels and registered them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.",

The villagers, you see, wanted to schedule a race so that they could support their compulsive gambling habits, but could not find their two main contestants, the tortoise and the hare, and were forced to search for replacements. \nNobody in the village was willing to race, because they all wanted to bet on it and get drunk during the race. \n\nAfter many hours of searching, they found the best replacements they could, which happened to be a snail and a dung beetle. Neither of them wanted to  race, but were forced to do so by the rest of the villagers. And so the race was scheduled for the next day. That night, snail and dung beetle went out to the bar in order to prepare themselves for their race. After many hours, and many exotic, alcohol-filled drinks, snail and dung beetle were prepared for their race, and went off to their separate houses in order to get some sleep before the big race.\n\nThe next morning, snail got up early and headed out to the racetrack, and dung beetle did the same. They stood ready at the start line and got prepared for the race. Soon, the shot was fired, and the race began.  The dung beetle appropriately pooped himself. and the snail hid inside his shell.

He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.  The butcher follows, dumbstruck.\n\nAs the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.  After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the \"stop\" button, then the butcher follows him off.\n\nThe dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the stoop.  He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.  He does this again and again. No answer.  So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door.   A big guy opens it and starts cursing and pummeling the dog.  \n\nThe butcher runs up screams at the guy: \"What the hell are you doing?  This dog's a genius!\"\n\nThe owner responds, \"Genius, my ass.  It's the second time this week he's forgotten his key!",

Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener.   Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home   and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses,   knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back.  \n\nSomehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food.    So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and   steady.  \n\nTwenty days pass, but no Poncho.  Joe   and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise.  Another day passes, and still no   Poncho, but a promise is a promise.  After three   more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve   starts getting restless.  \"I NEED FOOD!\" he says   with a hint of dementia in his voice.    \n\n\"NO!\" Joe retorts.  \"We promised.\"  \n\nFive more days pass.  Joe realizes that Poncho   probably skipped out to the Burger King down the   road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get   a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat.  But   then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out   behind a rock. \n\n\"Just for that, I'm not   going.",

You've got a lot of chickens to service here, and you cost me a lot of money. Have fun, but take your time.\"\n\nThe farmer points him toward the henhouse and the rooster takes off like a shot.\n\nWHAM! Randy nails every hen in the henhouse, three or four times. Randy runs out and sees a flock of geese down by the lake. WHAM! He nails all the geese. Randy runs to the pigpen, the cow pasture -- soon, he's been on every animal on the farm.\n\nThe farmer is distraught, worried that his expensive rooster won't even last the day.\n\nSure enough, the farmer wakes up the next morning to find Randy laid out flat in the middle of the yard, buzzards circling overhead.\n\nThe sad farmer shakes his head and says, \"Oh, Randy, I told you to pace yourself.\"\n\nRandy opens one eye, winks, and nods towards the sky, \"Shhh, they're getting closer.",

    "Joke": "A farm boy who had just finished his schooling on the farm, was sent by his Ma and Pa to the big city to go to college. The first thing the boy does when he gets to town, is go to find a whorehouse. He goes inside to talk to the madam about getting a girl. She leads him upstairs, opens the door to a room and tells him to sit and wait for the girl to arrive.\n\nAfter several minutes of anxious waiting, a young, blonde prostitute comes in. The boy is beside himself, and he leaps up from the bed, grabs the television, and throws it out the window. The girl thinks this is odd behavior, but she shrugs it off, and begins to undress. As she strips, the farmboy runs over, grabs the night stand and throws it out the window. Again the girl thinks this is odd, but being an experienced hooker, she figures it's a fetish and continues disrobing.  The girl removes her panties, and with that, the farm boy grabs the entire bed and starts lugging it toward the window. \n\nThe girl, figuring this is one even she hasn't heard of, finally asks, \"What the hell are you doing?\"\n\nThe farm boy replies, \"Ah ain't never been with no woman before but, if it's anythin' like fuckin' sheep, we gonna need all the room we can git.",

    "Joke": "All good Southerners already know these, but in fairness  to those Yankees who were dumb enough to stay down here:    \n\n\n1.  Don't order a steak at a Waffle House. They serve breakfast 24 hrs a day, so let them cook something they know.    \n\n2.  Don't laugh at people's names. Merleen, Bodie, Luther Ray, Tammy Ann, Mari Beth, and Inez have all been known to whip a man's ass for less than that.    \n\n3.  Don't order a bottle of pop or a can of soda -- this can lead to a merciless beating. Down South it's called Coke, even if you want a Pepsi.    \n\n4.  Don't show allegiances to any college football squad that isn't an SEC team. All the others are a bunch of candy asses who get to play Wyoming every week.    \n\n5.  Don't refer to Southerner's as a bunch of hillbillies. Many of us are/have been more literate than you (e.g. Welty, Williams, Faulkner), better educated, and generally much nicer to boot.  We've got plenty of business sense (e.g.Turner Broadcasting, MCI WorldCom, MTV, and Netscape). Naturally, we can have lapses of judgment from time to time (e.g. Clinton, Fordice, Duke). We don't care if you think we're dumb, we know better!  \n\n6.  We are fully aware that the humidity is high. Quit your bitching, spend your money, and leave.    \n\n7.  Don't order wheat toast at the Cracker Barrel. If you do this, everyone will know you're from Ohio. Eat the biscuits like God intended and for goodness sake, don't put sugar in your grits.   \n8.  Don't attempt to fake a Southern accent.  Nothing will incite a riot faster.    \n\n9.  Don't go around talking about how much better it is back home.  If you don't like it here, take your Yankee ass back home.    \n\n10. We don't play lacrosse, hockey or any of those other sissy ass Northern games, so don't ask about the scores. We...simply...don't...care.    \n\n11. We know how to speak proper English, we talk this way because we want to and we can. It's like playing jazz, you have to know how to do it right first.    \n\n12. Last, but by no means least...DO NOT try to tell us how to Bar-B-Q. This could lead to permanent expulsion and revocation of your work visa.    Consider yourself just damn lucky that we let you come down here in the first place. Don't push your luck!",

An older gentleman was simply amazed by this. ''I have a female parrot and she's just terrible. My son raised her and all she does is curse. She's the most foul mouthed creature I've ever heard,'' he sighed. ''Maybe if we put my parrot with your parrot he would teach mine how to pray and stop cursing so much.''\n\nThe woman readily agreed to this and a few days later the gentleman brought his parrot by. The woman's parrot sat praying in the bottom of the cage as they placed the female inside with him. The parrot instantly stopped praying, hopped up, looked the female over and shouted, ''Hot damn!! This is what I've been praying for!!''",

Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.\"\n\nJeffery figured he had nothing to lose, so he took his urine sample to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:\n\n\n  “You have tennis elbow.\n\n  Soak your arm in warm water.\n\n  Avoid heavy lifting.\n\n  It will be better in two weeks.”\n\n\n    Late that evening while thinking how\namazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter.  To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.\n\n    He went back to the drug store, located\nthe machine, poured in the sample and deposited $10.00. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:\n\n\n  “Your tap water is too hard.\n\n  Get a water softener.\n\n  \n\n  Your dog has worms.\n\n  Get him vitamins.\n\n  \n\n  Your daughter's using cocaine.\n\n  Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.\n\n  \n\n  Your wife's pregnant - twin girls.\n\n  They aren't yours.\n\n  Get a lawyer.\n  And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will\n  never get better.”",

I'll go into the closet and you go into the bathroom. We'll both get undressed and turn off the lights in the bedroom. And then on the count of three we'll both rush out at each other and then it will just happen in the middle of the bedroom.''    The wife is a bit unsure about this, but since she doesn't have any better ideas she agrees. \n\nSo, the husband goes into the closet and the wife goes into the bathroom and they both get undressed.    The anticipation is driving the husband mad and as he takes off his clothes he gets an enormous erection. The wife turns off the lights and on the count of three they both rush into the bedroom towards each other. But since the room is dark the husband gets disoriented and runs by his wife — right into the dresser. He hits the dresser so hard that he passes out from the pain.    \n\nThe next thing he remembers is coming to in a hosital bed, with a doctor looking down at him. His throbbing dick is still so painful that he moans to the doctor, ''Doc, doc, how bad is it?''  \n''That's nothing, son. Wait till you see your wife! We still haven't gotten her off the doorknob.''",

    "Title": "Some Character",
    "Joke": "Where do the characters go when I use my backspace or delete them on my PC?  \n\nANSWER: The characters go to different places, depending on whom you ask:\n\nThe Buddhist explanation: If a character has lived rightly, and its karma  is good, then after it has been deleted it will be reincarnated as a different, higher character. Those funny characters above the numbers on  your keyboard will become numbers, numbers will become letters, and lower-case letters will become upper-case. \n\nThe 20th-century bitter cynical nihilist explanation: Who cares? It doesn't really matter if they're on the page, deleted, undeleted, underlined, etc. It's all the same. \n\nThe Mac user's explanation: All the characters written on a PC and then  deleted go to straight to PC hell. If you're using a PC, you can probably see the deleted characters, because you're in PC hell also. \n\nStephen King's explanation: Every time you hit the (Del) key you unleash a tiny monster inside the cursor, who tears the poor, unsuspecting characters to shreds, drinks their blood, then eats them, bones and all.  Hah, hah, hah! \n\nThe Christian Church's approach to characters: The nice characters go to  Heaven, where they are bathed in the light of happiness. The naughty characters are punished for their sins. Naughty characters are those involved in the creation of naughty words, such as \"breast,\" \"sex,\" and contraception.\" \n\nDave Barry's explanation: The deleted characters are shipped to Battle Creek, Michigan, where they're made into Pop-Tart filling; this explains why Pop-Tarts are so flammable, while cheap imitations are not flammable.  I'm not making this up. \n\nIBM's explanation: The characters are not real. They exist only on the screen when they are needed, as concepts, so to delete them is merely to de-conceptualize them. Get a life. \n\nPETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) explanation: You've  been DELETING them??? Can't you hear them SCREAMING???

    "Title": "Rules of Bedroom Golf",
    "Joke": "1. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play.\n2. Play must be permitted by the owner of the hole.\n3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out.\n4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.  Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.\n5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole.\n6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is  satisfied that play is completed.  Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.\n7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the  hole immediately upon arrival at the course.  The  experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special attention to well-formed bunkers.\n8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played, or are currently  playing, to the owner of the course being  played.  Angry course owners have been known to damage players' equipment for this reason.\n9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.\n10. Players should ensure that the match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time.  Previous players have been known to  become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course.\n11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.  Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair.  Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play when this is the case.\n12.  The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush around the hole to allow for improved viewing of alignment with, and approach to the hole.\n13. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to play the back nine.\n14. Slow play is encouraged.  However, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request.\n15.  It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.",

Kennedy Airport:\n\nThe tile under the urinals in the Arrivals Building has that familiar lemony tinge; rubber soles stick to it. Over in Amsterdam, the tile under Schiphol's urinals would pass inspection in an operating room. But nobody notices. What everybody does notice is that each urinal has a fly in it. Look harder, and the fly turns into the black outline of a fly, etched into the porcelain.\n\n\"It improves the aim,\" says Aad Kieboom. \"If a man sees a fly, he aims at it.\" Mr. Kieboom, an economist, directs Schiphol's own building expansion. His staff conducted fly-in-urinal trials and found that etchings reduce spillage by 80%. The Dutch will transfer the technology to New York.\n\n\"We will put flies in the urinals yes,\" Jan Jansen says in a back office at the Arrivals Building. He is the new Dutch general manager, the boss as of noon today. \"It gives a guy something to think about. That's the perfect example of process control.\"\n\nBut a spokesperson for Rudy Guiliani, Mayor of New York, was heard to say, \"What do we need with Dutch flies when we have more than enough roaches to piss on?",

The man approached his father one day before the wedding and told him about his problem.  His feet REALLY stunk, even if he washed them constantly, he was worried that this would scare off his new bride, so he needed a solution, fast.  His father pondered the situation and finally told his son to wear socks constantly (even to bed) and always wash his feet whenever he got a chance.  \n\nThe son thought about this and went along happy.    The same day the young lady approached her mother and told her about her problem.  Her morning breath was horrid.  Her mother reassured her and told her everyone had bad morning breath.  The young woman told her mother that this was not normal morning breath but easily the worst in the world.  The mother thinks about this and comes up with this bright idea.  She tells her daughter to get up earlier than everyone else and don't say a thing, go make breakfast and then brush her teeth while the others are eating.  The young woman thinks and then runs off to get ready for the wedding, happy.      \n\nThe couple is married and they are happy, him with his perpetual socks and her with her morning silences.  One morning about 5:30 am the young man wakes up to find one sock missing.  He starts rustling around in the bed looking for it, which of course wakes up his wife, who without thinking asks what's wrong.    With a look of shock on his face the young man says, ''OH MY GOD! You've swallowed my sock!''",

    "Joke": "1. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes. \n\n2. A 3-year-old is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant.\n\n3. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite. \n4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42-pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of a large room. \n\n5. When using the ceiling fan as a baseball bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. \n\n6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit by a ceiling fan. \n\n7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words \"Uh-oh,\" it's already too late. \n\n8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. \n\n9. A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying glass can start a fire even on an overcast day. \n\n10. Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a six-year-old. \n\n11. \"Play-Doh\" and \"microwave\" should never be used in the same sentence. \n\n12. Super glue is forever. \n\n13. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't walk on water. \n\n14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O. \n\n15. VCRs do not eject PB&J sandwiches even though TV commercials show they do. \n\n16. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house 4 inches deep. \n\n17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise in a moving car. \n\n18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is. \n\n19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not like ovens. \n\n20. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms dizzy. It will, however, make cats dizzy. \n\n21. Cats spit up twice their body weight when dizzy.",

The man is at least six feet four, has a huge red beard and, despite the wind, mist, and near freezing temperatures, is  wearing only his kilt, a tweed shirt and a tam-o''-shanter at a rakish angle. \n\nAt the roadside there also stands a young woman. She is absolutely beautiful -- slim,  shapely, fair complexion, golden hair... heart stopping.  The driver stops and stares, and his attention is only distracted from the lovely girl when the red thing opens the car door and drags him from his seat onto the road with a fist resembling a whole raw ham.  \n\n''''Right, you Jimmy,'''' he shouts, ''''Ah want you to masturbate!''''  \n\n''''But......'''' stammers the driver.  \n\n''''Du it now - or I''ll bluddy kill yu!''''  \n\nSo the driver turns his back on the girl, drops his trousers and starts to masturbate.

''''Right laddie, du it agin!'''' demands the Highlander.  \n\nThis goes on for nearly two hours. The hapless driver gets cramps in both arms, he  has rubbed himself raw, is violently aching, his sight is failing and despite the cold wind, he has collapsed in a sweating, jibbering heap on the ground, unable to stand.\n\n''''Du it again!'''' says the Highlander. \n\n''''I can''t do it any more - you''ll just have to kill me!'''' whimpers the man.  \n\nThe Highlander looks down at the pathetic soul slumped on the roadside and says, ''''All right laddie.

The study concluded   that the reason the head of a man's penis is   larger than the shaft was to provide the man   with more pleasure during sex.  \n\nAfter the results were published, France decided   to conduct their own study on the same subject.    They were convinced that the results of the   British study was incorrect.  After three years   of research at a cost of in excess of $2   million, the French researchers concluded that   the head of a man's penis is larger than the   shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure   during sex.  \n\nWhen the results of the French study were   released, Canada decided to conduct their own   study.  The Canucks didn't really trust British   or French studies.  So, after nearly three weeks   of intensive research and a cost of right around   $75.00, the Canadian study was complete.  \nThey   concluded that the reason the head on a man's   penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent   your hand from flying off and hitting you in the   forehead!",

The meal went okay, but the President was sure that the soup tasted a little off and by the time dessert came, he was starting to have stomach cramps and nausea. It was getting worse and worse 'til finally he had to excuse himself from the state dinner to look for the bathroom. \n\nPassing through the kitchen, he caught sight of the cook, Jon, scratching his rear end and this made him feel even worse. By now he was desperately ill with violent cramps and was so disorientated that he couldn't remember which door led to the bathroom. He was on the verge of passing out from the pain when he finally found a door that opened and as he undid his trousers and ran in, he realized to his horror that he had stumbled into Monica Lewinsky's office with his trousers around his knees. As he was just about to pass out, she bent over him and heard her president whisper in a barely audible voice, “sack my cook.” \nAnd that is how the whole misunderstanding occurred.",

Then he had an idea; he would have a fish-eating competition.  \n\nWhen they had the competition, there were two finalists: a man from a place called Fife, whose name was Mr. Hicks; and a man that was from Sweden, whose name is Sven.  \nSo they had the final; the Mayor fired the starting pistol and they started eating the tench.  No sooner had Mr. Hicks bitten the fish than one of his teeth fell out.  He couldn''t eat because of this so he stopped, but the Mayor refused to stop the competition.  So Sven kept on eating and ended up eating nine of these tench fish. \n\n\nThe next day the headlines read:  ONE TOOTH FREE FOR FIFE HICKS, SVEN ATE NINE TENCH!",

    "Joke": "There was once a Scotsman and an Englishman who   lived next door to each other.  The Scotsman owned   a hen and each morning would look in his garden   and pick up one of his hen's eggs for breakfast.    One day he looked into his garden and saw that the   hen  had laid an egg in the Englishman's garden.   He was about to go next door when he saw the   Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to   the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged   to him because he owned the hen. The Englishman   disagreed because the egg was laid on his   property.  \n\n\n\"In my family,\" the Scotsman said, \"we normally solve disputes by   the following actions: I kick you in the balls and   time how long it takes you to get back up. Then   you kick me in the balls and time how long it   takes for me to get up. Whoever gets up quicker   wins the egg.\"   The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman   found his heaviest pair of boots  kicked the Englishman as hard as he could in the   balls. The Englishman fell to the floor clutching   his nuts and howled in agony for 30 minutes.    Eventually the Englishman stood up and said,   \"Now it's my turn to kick you.\"\n\n\n\"Keep the g**damn egg.",

Bush asked.    \n\n''He said, 'that's me,' so I hired him.'' \n\nBush patted Gorbachev on the shoulder. ''Thanks, Mikhail. That's a great idea.''    As soon as he got back to Washington, Bush called Dan Quayle over to the White House. \n\n''Dan,'' he said, ''I've got a question for you. Who is the son of your father but not your brother?'' \n\nQuayle looked rather puzzled. ''Can I get back to you on that in 24 hours, Mr. President?''  He was very troubled by this question. He kept thinking about it and thinking about it, but couldn't get anywhere. Finally, the thought struck him, ''I'll ask Jim Baker. He's a smart guy.''  Quayle called Baker on the phone. \n\n''Jim, I've got a question for you. Who is the son of your father, but not your brother?''    \n\n''That would be me,'' Baker replied. Quayle broke into a big smile. \n\n''Thanks, Jim. You've helped me out big time.'' He went running to the West Wing and burst into the Oval Office.    ''Mr. President, I have the answer!''    \n\n''Okay, Dan. Who is the son of your father, but not your brother?''    \n\n''It's Jim Baker!'' said Quayle.   \n\n''No,'' said Bush.

Defeated by George Bush and Michael Dukakis no less.\"\n \n\"The laws in this city are clearly racist. All laws are racist. The law of gravity is racist.\"\n \n\"I am making this trip to Africa because Washington is an international city, just like Tokyo, Nigeria, or Israel. As mayor, I am an international symbol.  Can you deny that to Africa?\"\n\n\"People have criticized me because my security detail is larger than the president's. But you must ask yourself: are there more people who want to kill me than who want to kill the president? I can assure you there are.\"\n \n\"The brave men who died in Vietnam, more than 100% of which were black, were the ultimate sacrifice.\"\n \n\"I read a funny story about how the Republicans freed the slaves. The Republicans are the ones who created slavery by law in the 1600's. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and he was not a Republican.\"\n \n\"What right does Congress have to go around making laws just because they deem it necessary?\"\n \n\"People blame me because these water mains break, but I ask you, if the water mains didn't break, would it be my responsibility to fix them then? WOULD IT!?!\"\n \n\"I am a great mayor; I am an upstanding Christian man; I am an intelligent man; I am a deeply educated man; I am a humble man.",

I was like, 'What do you mean it didn't work? It was a very expensive vibrator. I'll return it.' She's like, 'No, no, it functioned fine, but it didn't work for me. It didn't solve my problem.' At that moment, I realized that because I was the one who had bought her the vibrator, I kinda felt like I was the guy who hadn't screwed her the right way.

Most people keep a scrapbook of newspaper cuttings - especially if any of their family or friends has died in a strange boating accident. \n\n20. It does not matter if you are heavily outnumbered in a fight involved martial arts - your enemies will wait patiently to attack you one by one by dancing around in a threatening manner until you have knocked out their predecessor. \n\n21. During a very emotional confrontation, instead of facing the person you are speaking to, it is customary to stand behind them and talk to their back. \n\n22.

    "Joke": "Remember the book \"Men are from Mars, Women\nare from Venus\"? Well, here's a prime example offered by an English professor at\nSouthern Methodist University:\n\nIn-class Assignment for Wednesday:\n\nToday we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story. The process is simple.  Each person will pair off with the person sitting to his other immediate right.  One of you will then write the first paragraph of a short story.  The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story.  The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so on back and forth.  Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent. The story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached. The following was actually turned in by two of my  English students, Rebecca [last name deleted] and Gary [last name\ndeleted.] \"\n\nAt first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile.  But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl.  His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again.  So chamomile was out of the question.\n\nMeanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago.  \"A.S. Harris to Geostation 17,\" he said into his transgalactic communicator.  \"Polar orbit established.  No sign of resistance so far...\" But before he could sign off, a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay.  The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.\n\nHe bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him.  Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4. \"Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel,\" Laurie read in her newspaper one morning.  The news simultaneously excited  her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth  -- when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her.  \"Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?\" she pondered wistfully.\n\nLittle did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live.  Thousands of miles above the city, the Au'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles.  The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless  target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet.  With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85 million other Americans.  The President slammed his fist on the conference table. \"We can't allow this!  I'm going to veto that treaty! Let's blow'em out of the sky!\"\n\nThis is absurd.  I refuse to continue this mockery of literature. My writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic, semi-literate adolescent.\n\nYeah?  Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts at writing are the literary equivalent of Valium.\n\nAsshole.\n\nBitch.",

In much the same way, the\nhuman brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through which the\nelectrical signals pass. \n\nRecent emiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.   Thus, regular consumption of spirits helps eliminate the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. The result of this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of completing university\nstudies and then getting married and settling down, most professionals cannot keep up with\nthe performance of the new graduates.  Only those few that stick to the strict\nregimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that they\nachieved during their university years.\n\n    So, this is a call to arms.  As our\ncountry is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes.  But get\nback into the bars  and pubs and quaff that pint!  Your company and your country\nneeds you to be at your peak, and at your best, and you shouldn't deny yourself the career\nopportunities that you could achieve through excessive alcohol consumption.  Take\nlife by the bottle and be all that you can be!

He has been around forever, so I wouldn't put it past him to come up with something like this.\n\nAnyway, one year there were these two guys who were taking Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the mid-terms and labs, etc., such that going into the final they had a solid A. These friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem final was on Monday), they decided to go up to U Virginia and party with some friends up there.\n\nThey did this and had a great time.  However, with their hangovers and everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor Bonk after the final and explained to him why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to UVA for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back to campus. \n\nBonk thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were elated, relieved and very proud of their story. So, they studied that night and went in the next day at the time Bonk had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin.\n\nThey looked at the first problem, which was something simple about molarity and solutions and was worth 5 points. \"Cool,\" they thought, \"this is going to be easy.\" They did that problem and turned the page. They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on the next page...\n\nWHICH TIRE? (95 points)",

    "Joke": "A hurricane capsizes a cruise ship in the Caribbean. A stock broker washes ashore on a remote island. Outside of the beautiful scenery, a fresh water pool and bananas, there is little else.\n\nOne day, after several months have passed, a gorgeous woman in a small rowboat appears.\n\n\"Wow! I can't believe I found another person!\" she exclaims. \"Were you on the cruise ship, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was,\" he answers. \"Where did you get that rowboat?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she says, \"I found it washed up on the beach. Where is your shelter?\"\n\n\"To be honest, I've just been sleeping on the sand,\" he says.\n\nShe invites him to her side of the island. Once she's rowed them to her side, she ties up the boat with hand-woven rope. \"It took forever to find enough washed up strands to braid that length of rope,\" she tells him.\n\nShe leads him to a cozy bungalow painted blue and green. \"I scouted for felled trees and then stained the salvaged wood with these really juicy berries I found in the jungle,\" she tells him.\n\nOnce inside, she excuses herself to slip into something more comfortable. She returns wearing revealing silk lingerie, smiling provocatively.\n\n\"I found some washed up suitcases from the cruise ship a few weeks ago,\" she tells him. \"But now that I've found you, I finally have a reason to wear something sexy again. Tell me, haven't you been lonely? Isn't there something that you really, really miss? Something you've been longing for, too?\"\n\n\"Oh wow!\" exclaims the man. \"You mean you've found the Internet, too?!",

In fact, save them until the job is almost done.  No\nuse confusing me with useful information.\n10.  Never introduce me to the people\nyou're with.  I have no right to know anything.  In the corporate food chain, I\nam plankton.  When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them.\n11.  Be nice to me only when the job I'm\ndoing for you could really change your life and send you straight to managers' hell.\n12.  Tell me all your little problems.\n  No one else has any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate.  I\nespecially like the story about having to pay so much taxes on the bonus check you\nreceived for being such a good manager.\n13.  Wait until my yearly review and THEN\ntell me what my goals SHOULD have been.

    "Joke": "Whether the cause is a previous night of drinking or a big lunch, the outcome is the same: Farts. \n\nSeventy percent of the time, we can dispense freely. The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions. \n  \nHolders - The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk. \n  \nDesk Jockey -  When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider: \n\n- Do you have your own office? Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. I also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females. \n\n- Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk? If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area. If it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days. There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heal on the floor. I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event. \n \nMeetings: - Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time. Meetings and gas really do not mix. Releasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in. Although I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it. It really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting. This will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected. Warning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline. Of course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. You have free reign to do whatever you like. \n \nAisle Walker: - Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option. By the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident. The added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice. \n \nBroom Closet: - One option is to find a broom closet and release inside the closet. The only drawback is explaining why you were in the broom closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet. I found stashing stationery supplies in the closet provides a nice excuse. People will love you for informing them about the backup stationery supply cabinet. Of course, you then have to find another closet, as your original place will become too risky.\n \nAnd remember, if you're workplace has many open flames, you are on your own.",

''You mean you're the one who got him to?'' \n\nHis wife knodded. The husband thought it over, then sighed. ''I guess that's okay.

    "Joke": "Two weeks ago was my forty-fifth birthday, and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning anyway. I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say “Happy Birthday,” and probably have a present for me. \n\nShe didn't even say “Good Morning,” alone any “Happy Birthday.” I thought, “Well, that's wives for you. Maybe the children will remember.”\n\nThe children came in to breakfast and didn't say a word.    \n\nWhen I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet, said, “Good morning boss, Happy Birthday.”  And I felt a little better; someone had remembered. \n\nI worked until noon. Then Janet knocked on my door and said, “You know, it's such a beautiful day outside and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me.” I said, “By George, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go.” \n\nWe went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go; we went out into the country to a little private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. \n\nOn the way back to the office, she said, “You know, it's such a beautiful day. We don't need to go back to the office, do we?” I said, “No, I guess not.” She said, “Let's go to my apartment.” After arriving at her apartment she said, “Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable.” \n\n“Sure,” I excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife, children and dozens of our friends. All were singing “Happy Birthday” and there on the couch I sat... naked.",
